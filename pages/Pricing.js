                Yes, we allow 1 hour to set up and 1 hour to clean and pack up.
                Note that this is <strong>not </strong>included in your service
                time, but often we are ready to go early if you need something

                can always discuss the best way to fit into your space. We can
                also add imagery/branding to our setup if that would help.

                We always suggest working out the amount of hours you want
                people to mingle and then adding one. We can also smash out
                coffees in 1-2 hours if that's what you need. Note that a longer
                time period is sometimes cheaper, as we need to bring less
                baristas and machines to get through the drinks in time.

                All we require is a deposit to secure the booking (the greater
                of 20% or $250). This deposit is fully refundable if you cancel
                with at least a week's notice. The balance is due the day of the
                event.

                Depending if we have enough supplies for that beverage (beans,

                the ad hoc price listed on your quote. It's always safer to make
