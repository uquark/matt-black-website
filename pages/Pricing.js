              <p>
                Well a list of our standard drinks:
                <br />
                Cappucino, flat white, latte, piccolo, macchiato, short black,
                long black, filer, cold brew, iced milk coffee, iced black
                coffee, green tea, oolong tea, black tea, herbal tea and
                babycinos (not included in drink quota).

              <h3>What milks do you use?</h3>
              <p>
                If not specified we bring along full cream, skim, almond and soy
                milk. We also have access to oat milk and full cream jersey
                milk&nbsp;(makes hands down the creamiest and most delicious
                milk coffees we've tasted).

              <h3>Do you need time to set up/pack up?</h3>
              <p>
                Yes, we allow 1 hour to set up and 1 hour to clean and pack up.
                Note that this is <strong>not </strong>included in your service
                time, but often we are ready to go early if you need something
                to get you going beforehand!

              <h3>Can you use my existing bench/kitchen/space?</h3>
              <p>
                We bring our own bench top setups that look schmick, however we
                can always discuss the best way to fit into your space. We can
                also add imagery/branding to our setup if that would help.

              <p>
                We're currently working on our food offerings to provide house
                made cakes and patisseries in the future. Watch this space!

                How long should I book you for a certain number of people?
              </h3>
              <p>
                We always suggest working out the amount of hours you want
                people to mingle and then adding one. We can also smash out
                coffees in 1-2 hours if that's what you need. Note that a longer
                time period is sometimes cheaper, as we need to bring less
                baristas and machines to get through the drinks in time.

              <h3>Do I pay now or later?</h3>
              <p>
                All we require is a deposit to secure the booking (the greater
                of 20% or $250). This deposit is fully refundable if you cancel
                with at least a week's notice. The balance is due the day of the
                event.

            <div>
              <h3>What if I need more drinks than I originally planned?</h3>
              <p>
                Depending if we have enough supplies for that beverage (beans,
                milk, tea leaves) we're happy to smash out some more drinks for
                the ad hoc price listed on your quote. It's always safer to make
                sure you've ordered a sufficient amount upfront, to ensure we
                bring enough of everything to keep your guests happy.
