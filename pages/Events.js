        We offer several blends for milk <br />
        coffees that are renowned for their quality, no cheap "home blends"
        here.
        <br />‍<br />A range of single origin beans are available from the
        country's BEST roasters. Naturally we're able to serve these as espresso
        or filter.
        <br />‍<br />
        We also provide exquisite teas, and iced beverages for those hot summer
        days.

      </h2>
      <p>
        We only use equipment that would look at home in a high end coffee
        roastery. It's tricky to get consistent delicious coffee at your
        home/office/dream wedding venue, so we bring the right tools.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our professional baristas are not just highly trained, they are
        experienced and knowledgeable about everything coffee - from brewing to
        terroir.
